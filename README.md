# SupervisedLearningAssignment
Repository created for the datascience 3 supervised learning assignment

Author: Rients Dalstra

The assignment uses the parkinson dataset from: 
```
Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection,
Little MA, McSharry PE, Roberts SJ, Costello DAE, Moroz IM. 
BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2007, 6:23 (26 June 2007)
```
The data is not included in the repository and can be downloaded from:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons 

To run the assignment make sure that both the <i>'Supervised_Functions.ipynb'</i> and the <i>'Supervised_learning_assignment.ipynb'</i> are stored in the same location.

Then open the <i>'Supervised_learning_assignment.ipynb'</i> notebook and then run the cells. Running all the cells will raise one exception halfway through the notebook.
This is to prevent the hyperparameter tuning functions from running automatically as they consume a lot of computing power.

The packages used during the assignment are:
```
Python 3.9.7
• Pandas 1.3.5
• Numpy 1.21.2
• Sklearn 1.0.2
• Matplotlib 3.5.0
• Scipy 1.7.3
• Seaborn 0.11.2
• Eli5 0.13.0
```
